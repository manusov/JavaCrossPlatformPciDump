This platform supported by Legacy Reader, released May, 1, 2021.
This platform not supported by MCFG raw read mechanism.
ASUS P5V-VM-Ultra

MCFG base = E0000000h
When saving MCFG, hang on address = E00A7820h =
1110.0000.0000.1010.0111.1000.0010.0000b

1110           = MCFG base address = E0000000h
0000.0000      = Bus 0
1010.0         = Device 14h = 20
111            = Function 7
1000.0010.0000 = Register 820h 

Register address not associated directly with hang.
Bus, Device, Function is actual.

For this platform, cannot fix problem by CMOS setup.
Remove post card, disable onboard devices not fix problem.

Possible solutions:
Required intellectual reader,
not scan all 8 PCI functions if single-function device,
not scan if device absent ( Vendor ID = Device ID = FFFFh ).
But required optional "raw scan all" mode for find undocumented resources.
