Hang on unused function 1 of CMD Technology (Silicon Image) RAID Controller.

MCFG base    = E0000000h
Hang address = E0129700h

E0129700h = 1110.0000.0001.0010.1001.0111.0000.0000b

PCI bus      = 1
PCI device   = 5
PCI function = 1

E0129700h = Hang on unused function 1 of CMD Technology RAID Controller.
E0128000h = Normal view used function 0 of CMD Technology RAID Controller.

Temporary solution:
Can save dump if disable CMD Technology (Silicon Image) RAID Controller
by CMOS Setup.

Possible solutions:
Required intellectual reader,
not scan all 8 PCI functions if single-function device.
But required optional "raw scan all" mode for find undocumented resources.
