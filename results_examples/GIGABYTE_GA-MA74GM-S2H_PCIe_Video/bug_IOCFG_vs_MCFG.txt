This platform supported with bug.

If read configuration space by legacy ports CFGADDR/CFGDATA (0CF8h/0CFCh),
both under DOS (ICDiag) or under Windows (RWEverything),
CPU internal resources (PCI bus 0, device 18h, functions 0-3) present.

If read configuration space by memory-mapped configuration space,
both under DOS (ICDiag) or under Windows (RWEverything),
CPU internal resources (PCI bus 0, device 18h, functions 0-3) absent.

Cause:
Old CPU without support PCI Express architecture.
For this platform, MCFG provided by I/O bridge (chipset).

Possible solutions:
1) Design reader for legacy mode (ports CFGADDR/CFGDATA).
2) Hyper-transport specific memory mapped configuration.
Variant (1) is more universal, for all legacy platforms.
